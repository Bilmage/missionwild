                                                                        J.P. writes, “For quite a while I have felt that SEEK’s best and unique feature is our Environmental Camps. When we combine our talents, knowledge, professionalism, love for God and the natural and unique campus that SEEK offers, it is one of the most effective ways of not only teaching young people environmental stewardship, but pointing them to the Creator.
                                                                        
                                                                        Curt adds, “Many of their lives have been transformed by the Word of God while attending camps. Through the wilderness trails and the many experiential learning activities, the children become more aware of their environment, and this affects how they treat it. They get three very nice meals a day and a snack, and many comment that they did not know people can eat like this. The children leave energized, and we hear from many parents that their children have been educating them at home on what they learned.”
                                                                        
                                                                        Nick Odhiambo writes, “What we do best at SEEK is The School Environmental Clubs where pupils are trained in environmental stewardship. The way we do this is unique and found with no other organization since it is Bible Based Environmental Conservation training. I recall that when World Vision (a Christian NGO) wanted to engage school pupils in their Integrated Climate Protection Project funded by BMZ, they came to us and said that we are the only organization doing this with school children. They said they had to have us involved to ensure success!”
                                                                        
                                                                        “This project has had a great influence in the lives of the children involved and their families. A specific example is Michael Marinda in Mbita Primary School. AboychanginghisVillage croppedHis father Boaz Luke came to me to thank me for inculcating environmental stewardship in his son. He said that the boy has completely changed the attitude of the rest of his family members towards the environment and their role in caring for it! He went on to explain that the boy had taught him new ways of tree planting and care that he had never known! He said that all the trees that the boy planted at home were better that those planted by his siblings and dad. Mr. Boaz wanted to take us to his home to witness this impact but we had no time as we were already late and had to travel back to Mbita after a very successful session on alternative sources of income under Conservation.”
                                                                        
                                                                         
                                                                        
                                                                        “Mbita Primary School emerged the best overall club in Clubs Tree Planting Competition for this year. The unique thing about what they did was that they did their project in a very dry and bare ground to introduce shade around the school playground. In spite of the ground being very rocky, dry and bare, they went ahead and prepared holes in which they planted Albizia Coriaria (Albizia), a wide canopy tree species to provide shade that would help people who come to watch soccer games in the school playground. The procedure followed in doing this exercise was meticulous but the detail observed- taking care of rich soil needed for a good start-up and a well-planned drip kit for irrigating the planted seedlings-ensured their survival.  By the time of evaluation, all the 43 seedlings given to them were sparkling healthy.”
                                                                        
                                                                         
                                                                        
                                                                        As for the Magnificent Kids Orphan Scholars  Program, Curt comments, “The way school fees are provided through SEEK is different from most similar ministries. We don’t just want a kid to go to school, we want to see the family transformed. The families/guardians are required to contribute to school costs so that they can be part of the education as well. Students are required to work at the base 2 days a week while out of school so they can experience that joy of earning their fees. While at the base, they are ministered to and help each other out if one is struggling in a certain subject or area. We make visits to see their home life and meet regularly with the parent/guardian. We are excited to see the kids get an education but what excites us more is that they know they have a place where people love them unconditionally, a place to talk, and a place to see God.
                                                                        
                                                                         
                                                                        
                                                                        We are proud of two of these scholars Sam Agunda, who has just graduated from Meru University in Actuarial Science and of Walter Obado who on Dec. 2nd graduated from a two year program in Agriculture at Rongo University!  Walter did so well that he will be able to finish his university full degree anywhere in Kenya.
                                                                        
                                                                        They are both wonderful guys! We all are so proud of these magnificent scholars and giving people!
                                                                        
                                                                         
                                                                        
                                                                        RE: Widows Isaiah 61 Project, J.P. reports, “Consolata Agutu, mother to 7 children has two young daughters still under her care. Consolata’s livelihood was the difficult work of pulling fishing nets from the shore.  She also made charcoal and collected and sold the tiny fish, omena. After being trained at SEEK, she has the confidence and knowledge of how to plant trees and start her own tree nursery.”
                                                                        
                                                                        “SEEK provided her a donkey with which she now transports water for people in the village, earning enough to pay for her daughters’ school fees.  Furthermore, she is able to collect water from the Lake for her own domestic use.  SEEK was able to install her water tank and a 15-square meter enclosure for a home garden and protected area for raising tree seedlings.  When asked about her goals, she said it was to make good use of the new home garden for food. I helped her plant papaya trees a little while ago as the rains were coming.  She prefers not to spend time at the fishing village fishing or collecting fish. It is a depraved and dangerous place. She proclaims that she is born again and has dedicated her life to God, and attends a church which has also given her help.  Consolata prays that God will add more days to her life.  She and her children thank S.E.E.K. for all it has done for them.” (You enabled this all!)

Sadly in Suba it is a time when unsupervised, parentless young people are looking for some way to celebrate.  They end up in bars, where they are given alcohol and abused in shameful ways.
                                                                        
                                                                         
                                                                        
                                                                        Hezron, Mary and the youth ministry team are planning a Christmas celebration for 32 orphans—all the MKs along with other youth from the area. Hezron and team will take 15 boys for an adventure hike and an overnight on the 23rd to Rang’wa Hill in Sindo, and 17 girls will be with Mary for an overnight at the base. They will all get together December 24th for a dinner where they will discuss CPR+ (Creating Positive Relationships through Christ) and see ways they can reach young people together on the 25th.                                                                                                             Hezron writes, “We will also pray for each other, trusting God for a successful year ahead. All MKs will be back from high school so we will send them out to meet young people in groups of two (Jesus style). We may do the same on January 1st in Sindo.”

Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holiness and godliness. 2 Peter 3
                                                                        
                                                                         
                                                                        
                                                                        At that time we were grateful for the unseen realities of whatever of lasting value had come from our lives as the physical burned up.
                                                                        
                                                                        But over the past 3 weeks, we have been astounded by the power of these unseen values in others, the loving concern and actions of so many helping so many. These realities are carried in the hearts of humans and manifested back into the physical.
                                                                        
                                                                         
                                                                        
                                                                        Our deepest gratitude-I cannot write this without crying-to you very precious people who have loved us and given in so many ways:

People were clearly very moved and sympathetic and eager to hear more details, that things were going to work out for you. those kids of yours have some truly great and kind friends. I hope you somehow (in the spirit perhaps?) can feel the concern and love emanating at you from these thousands of miles away. 😊 “

In most schools the top ten I scoring students were SEEK Club Kids!

                                                                        Hezron reported, “It was a great camp in which many students were helped. Their stories of suffering were touching, and we realized the camp was at key timing in their lives! We had 1 counselor for every 5 students, and the counseling went very well. The Officer in Charge of the Police Station came to talk to the students and his interaction with them was excellent.”

The students helped and the Ogal family contributed pipes and labor so that it was a community effort; they will also benefit having the water connection much nearer to their compounds. (SOUNDS LIKE CHRISTMAS!) “At the end of camp the students did not want to go home saying it felt like moving from the presence of God back to terrible situations. They commented on the love and peace they felt while here.”

He reports,” It was quite a joyful moment at graduation as I witnessed how wonderful our God is! Of the 39 students enrolled for the course, only six graduated! Fortunately, I was among them and topped the list in performance!”

One writes to his sponsor, “It is still in my memory how it was not well with me as the only boy who remained in the village when the others joined high schools of their choice. I thank God for the hope and joy restored through you when I was able to join high school. I am working hard so that your sponsorship will not be wasted.”

Some weeks 2000.

Trees sold are cared for, benefit the people who bought them, and are one of the most significant way of restoring environment. Research done in Israeli’s forests shows that if only 12% of the arid places of the world were reforested, a gigaton of carbon would be sequestered, equivalent to shutting 1000 coal plants! So thanks for helping us plant trees. The school children alone have maintained over 1000 trees. I will place the cedar in the wilderness, the acacia, the myrtle and the olive tree.. that they may recognize that the hand of the Lord has done this.” Is.41:19-20

                                                                    <div class="greennature-blog-content">These things I have spoken to you in order that in Me you may be having peace. In the world you are having tribulation. But be having courage. I have come off victorious over the world with a permanent victory. Jn 16:33

                                                                        God has solutions for every tribulation, every challenge. We must step out in courage: The Magnificents: “God is your Father. Just go believing,” Hezron told the Magnificents, several teen orphans with no family and no school fees, five years ago when it was time to go to secondary boarding school. They went in faith, and God provided for them. We remember Samson saying, “I feel like the son of a King” when money showed up for his school.
                                                                        Samson
                                                                        Five years later they are on partial scholarships in some of the best universities in Kenya. The subsidized cost per semester for them is around $325. Again they stepped out in faith and traveled to their universities without their tuition. Two gracious ladies have given a start for them which has been applied to their university fees. Syprose and Samson had used loans to start small businesses from which they were able to pay some of their fees. Syprose owes $90 for her first semester, and Samson owes just $50. Maxwell owes $180. A great investment for the future of Kenya. These are young people of awesome character.
                                                                        In Suba, degraded land and climate change from deforestation have made hunger a killer. Farming God’s Way We asked for sponsors for this and you responded! Creation Care in Kijabe hosted a Farming God’s Way training and with your help it was funded for four of our staff. This kind of conservation agriculture came through an answer to a Zimbabwe farmer’s prayer. With FGW, the same land that once bore 2 sacks of corn now produces over 50 sacks. Nick wrote, “Praise God! I can’t thank enough for the experience we had at the FGW training! It was a life changing experience. The course involves giving your whole life to Christ in everything you do. It entails striving to meet the needs of the poor and combating poverty through helping the poor attain food security in agriculture that gives God glory as the first farmer, the first gardener and forester! ”
                                                                        
                                                                        compressedThe Isaiah 61 Widow Agriculture second phase is underway, with the ladies out working on projects on each other’s properties. Again, widows with land: Benta, Damaris, Pamela, Roseline and Beatrice are finding ways to restore their land’s productivity for agri-business. SEEK Agricultural Head, Paul A’bongo writes, “They are lively, active, interactive, teachable and committed to learning; They have been committed to transformative Bible study and spirit building devotions every morning. This increasingly left positive marks in the lives of the widows. They have developed a communal attitude to work with each other and face the challenges in their communities with innovative remedies.” Please pray for God’s solution to their water challenge. We know He has one!
                                                                        ACC Rwanda- Thank you so much to those who funded Hezron’s participation in the African Christian Camping training in Rwanda, where he served on its board in support role. As always, he returned with enthusiasm for implementation of ways to work as a team, disciple and to bring in money needed to keep the ministry ongoing. He has already shared with staff.
                                                                        Paga Primary School Reward Tour to Kisumu. Again thank you. The students said it was “WOW!” The teachers were so grateful for the students’ exposure to many learning opportunities and fun.
                                                                        Now the first place winners, Mbita Primary, are offered free housing, food, and a tour of the Environmental Education Center at Elsamere in Naivasha, where Elsa the Lion was reintroduced into the wild by Joy and George Adamson, a great breakthrough. $800 is all needed for the travel of the 40 member environmental club to this wonderful place.
                                                                        Before we left Kenya, a Board of Directors was formed there: Presbyter Gombe, Nicholas Odhiambo, David Okeyo, Hezron Obado, J.P. Pierce . They are leaders of faith and integrity who complement each other. They are doing a fantastic job working together for a balanced and forward focused ministry, with tight accountability. Don and I are also on the board and thanks to technology are in touch continually. Meanwhile we are seeking God for His direction in this phase of how we can most successfully support this ministry and its call.
                                                                        Also thanks to the one who donated money for Consolata Agutu to have a donkey to bring water from the lake for her tree nursery and for a small business. She is happy!
                                                                        Jeremy Roberts has been visiting at SEEK for two months. What an awesome young man he is with a positive attitude, friendly, helpful, wise. The staff really appreciate him. Thanks to all who contributed for his visit.
                                                                        LIGHT / SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS 12 SEEK staff go home to dark houses, where kerosene lamps are the only source of light. Purchasing the kerosene is a constant expense and so on some nights their children have no light for homework. A great solution is Bright Box- a small solar panel with bright bulbs for 4 lighting points in their houses and a cell phone charger enabling them to enjoy lit homes. It comes with a two year guarantee. It is the system Don and I use. A green sustainable solution. Cost $135 each
                                                                        STAFF Our staff serve from their hearts, but when they do not get salaries, their families suffer. We really appreciate all of you who faithfully give toward their salaries or to general funds. You are supporting skilled and effective people who are in the business of transforming lives so that the neediest people are becoming productive givers.
                                                                        Thank you for caring. We are grateful for your generous hearts. For your prayers!
                                                                        Don and Nancy Richards and SEEK Staff

                                                                        Charity Pros is running an online auction for Suba Environmental Education of Kenya/ ministry of Kenya Islands Mission, Inc. !!!
                                                                        Go to http://charitypros.com/?cat=74 The Auction runs from the 10th through the 18th of February. The proceeds will be used for ministry to the orphans and widows of Suba District, including their involvement in restoring the degraded environment and improving their communities with health, agriculture, reforestation, etc.. Charity Pros takes a small percent just to cover their costs. Crafts are already here in Tennessee.

Margaret, a wonderful woman who did much to improve the plight of widows, died in November and this will be the last chance to purchase her classic crafts.

This will be followed by a one night safari to the beautiful Nakuru National Park (below) home to millions of pink flamingo, who provide a breath taking sight as they take flight. Nakuru also is home to rhino, lions, giraffe, zebra, leopard, hippo, hyena, monkeys, baboon, many antelope species, wild pig, etc. A stay at one of Nairobi’s finest hotels and visits to crafts and places of note in Nairobi will end the trip.

The students and staff in the school were wonderful, mature Christians, full of fun and devoted to God. It was a privilege to share there. We witnessed supernatural abundance from the gardens where organic farming techniques are being implemented.
                                                                        Terry and Donna Keith, the leaders of that base, treated us so hospitably. They took us to Ballena Beach near Panama, located in a marine reserve, where jungle meets the brilliant blue of the Pacific. We were overwhelmed with the intricate detailing and amazing wisdom of our God in this part of His creation. Hermit crabs, howler monkeys, a whale and noisy parrots entertained us.
